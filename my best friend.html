	<p>Friendship is a wonderful gift that not everyone gets to experience fully. While we meet many people in our journey through life, only a select few truly leave a lasting impression. My best friend is one such remarkable person who has had a profoundly positive impact on my life.
		<br>
		Our friendship grew stronger, and we became best friends. Our teachers noticed it too. We helped each other with school and college work and had friendly competition to see who could do better. This motivated us to improve our skills.
Besides academics, we both loved playing ping-pong. We joined an academy and practiced together in the evenings. We even played doubles on our college team and won many competitions, making our parents and teachers proud.
After school, we took different career paths and lived in different cities for a while. However, fate brought us back together in the same city after a few years. My friend has always been a crucial support in my life.</p>
